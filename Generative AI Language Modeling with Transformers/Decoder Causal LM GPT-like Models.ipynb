We'll start with the basics, like getting our environment ready and preparing our data by breaking it down into tokens and turning those tokens into numbers the model can understand. Then, we'll dive into building the model itself, focusing on how it learns to pay attention to different parts of the text to generate text. Along the way, we'll cover how to train our model with data. Finally, we'll see how to use our trained model to create text based on what it has learned.\n","\n","## GPT models\n","\n","GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer) is a decoder-only model because it is trained using a causal language modeling objective, where the goal is to predict the next token in a sequence given the previous tokens. During training, the input sequence is shifted to the right, and the model learns to generate output tokens autoregressively, one at a time. This process allows GPT to generate coherent and contextually relevant text based on the given input prompt. In this lab you will learn how to create and train a decoder-only GPT-like model. However, please note that the actual GPT models are larger models and are trained on massive training data for specific NLP tasks.\n","\n","## GPT vs. ChatGPT\n","\n","GPT and ChatGPT are both AI models developed by OpenAI, but they serve different purposes and have distinct functionalities.\n","\n","GPT is a family of large-scale transformer-based language models trained on diverse internet text data. GPT models are designed for a wide range of natural language processing tasks, such as text generation, translation, summarization, and question-answering. They generate responses based on the input text (prompt) but do not maintain a consistent conversation history.\n","\n","On the other hand, ChatGPT is a fine-tuned version of the GPT model, specifically designed for conversational AI applications. It is trained to maintain a consistent conversation history and generate contextually relevant responses, making it more suitable for chatbot-like interactions. ChatGPT excels at understanding and generating human-like dialogues, providing coherent and engaging responses in a conversational setting.\n"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"08c01adb-a425-40f3-b736-920366e314b3","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["## __Table of contents__\n","\n","<ol>\n","    <li><a

This model aims to generate text and perform various NLP tasks. Below is an explanation of the main components of the class:\n","\n","- **Initialization (`__init__`)**: The constructor takes several parameters including `embed_size`, `vocab_size`, `num_heads`, `num_layers`, `max_seq_len`, and `dropout`. It initializes the embedding layer, positional encoding, transformer encoder layers, and a linear layer (`lm_head`) for generating logits over the vocabulary.\n","\n","- **Weight initialization (`init_weights`)**: This method initializes the weights of the model for better training convergence. The Xavier uniform initialization is used, which is a common practice for initializing weights in deep learning.\n","\n","- **Decoder (`decoder`)**: Although named `decoder`, this method currently functions as the forward pass through the transformer encoder layers, followed by the generation of logits for the language modeling task. It handles the addition of positional encodings to the embeddings and applies a mask if necessary.\n","\n","- **Forward pass (`forward`)**: This method is similar to the `decoder` method and defines the forward computation of the model. It processes the input through embedding layers, positional encoding, transformer encoder layers, and produces the final output using the `lm_head`.\n","\n","- **Mask generation**: Both `decoder` and `forward` methods contain logic to generate a square causal mask if no source mask is provided. This mask ensures that the prediction for a position does not depend on the future tokens in the sequence, which is important for the autoregressive nature of GPT models.\n","\n","- **Commented out decoder**: A section of the code is commented out, suggesting an initial design where a transformer decoder layer was considered. However, the final implementation uses only encoder layers, which is a common simplification for models focusing on language modeling and generation.\n","\n","This class effectively encapsulates the necessary components to create a GPT-like model, allowing for training on language modeling tasks and text generation applications.\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","id":"87358276-0312-4c68-bc19-ebce8a809229","metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":["class CustomGPTModel(nn.Module):\n    def __init__(self, embed_size,vocab_size, num_heads, num_layers, max_seq_len=500,dropout=0.1):\n\n        super().__init__()\n\n        self.init_weights()\n        self.embed = nn.Embedding(vocab_size, embed_size)\n        self.positional_encoding = PositionalEncoding(embed_size, dropout=dropout)\n\n        print( embed_size )\n\n\n        # Remaining layers are part of the TransformerDecoder\n        encoder_layers = nn.TransformerEncoderLayer(d_model=embed_size, nhead=num_heads, dropout=dropout)\n        self.transformer_encoder = nn.TransformerEncoder(encoder_layers, num_layers=num_layers)\n        self.embed_size = embed_size\n        self.lm_head = nn.Linear(embed_size, vocab_size)\n\n    def init_weights(self):\n      for p in self.parameters():\n          if p.dim() > 1:\n              nn.init.xavier_uniform_(p)\n\n    def create_mask(src,device=DEVICE):\n        src_seq_len = src.shape[0]\n        src_mask = nn.Transformer.generate_square_subsequent_mask(src_seq_len)\n        src_padding_mask = (src == PAD_IDX).transpose(0, 1)\n        return src_mask,src_padding_mask\n\n    def decoder(self, x,src_mask):\n        seq_length = x.size(0)\n\n        # Add positional embeddings to the input embeddings\n        x = self.embed(x)* math.sqrt(self.embed_size)\n        x = self.positional_encoding(x)\n\n        if src_mask is None:\n            \"\"\"Generate a square causal mask for the sequence.
