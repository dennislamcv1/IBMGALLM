## Generative AI Engineering with LLMs Specialization (7 course series)

The Gen AI market is expected to grow 46% .  yearly till 2030 (Source: Statista). Gen AI engineers are high in demand. This program gives aspiring data scientists, machine learning engineers, and AI developers essential skills in Gen AI, large language models (LLMs), and natural language processing (NLP) employers need. 

Gen AI engineers design systems that understand human language. They use LLMs and machine learning to build these systems.

During this program, you will develop skills to build apps using frameworks and pre-trained foundation models such as BERT, GPT, and LLaMA. You’ll use the Hugging Face transformers library, PyTorch deep learning library, RAG and LangChain framework to develop and deploy LLM NLP-based apps. Plus, you’ll explore tokenization, data loaders, language and embedding models, transformer techniques, attention mechanisms, and prompt engineering. 

Through the series of short-courses in this specialization, you’ll also gain practical experience through hands-on labs and a project, which is great for interviews. 

This program is ideal for gaining job-ready skills that GenAI engineers, machine learning engineers, data scientists and AI developers require. Note, you need a working knowledge of Python, machine learning, and neural networks.. Exposure to PyTorch is helpful.
